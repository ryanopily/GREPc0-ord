# GREPc0-ord

GREPc0-ord is just a fun and easy project that I might later intergrate into a bigger project.  
It (slowly) searches through all your guilds and channels to look for specific messages.

Right now, it only looks for discord invite links from all guilds and channels in the json received from the Discord API.

**Example usage: main.py -t <token> -q I**

Usage is more complicated, but features are not complete.   
You can look in main.py for more details.
